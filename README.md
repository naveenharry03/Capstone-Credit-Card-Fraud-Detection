# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project focuses on predicting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models with customer-level data. The dataset, consisting of 2,84,807 transactions, including 492 fraudulent cases, requires addressing class imbalance.Banking fraud poses a significant threat, estimated to reach $30 billion globally by 2020. Machine learning plays a crucial role in proactive fraud detection, helping banks reduce manual reviews, chargebacks, and the denial of legitimate transactions.Credit card fraud encompasses various tactics, such as skimming, manipulation, counterfeiting, theft, and telemarketing. By leveraging machine learning, this project aids financial institutions in combating fraud, preserving customer trust, and minimizing financial losses and operational expenses.

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

 

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. 

 

The data set is taken from the Kaggle website and has a total of 2,84,807 transactions; out of these, 492 are fraudulent. Since the data set is highly imbalanced, it needs to be handled before model building.

 

Business problem overview
For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.


It has been estimated by Nilson Report that by 2020, banking frauds would account for $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing in new and different ways. 

 

In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not only a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees as well as denials of legitimate transactions.

 

Understanding and defining fraud
Credit card fraud is any dishonest act or behaviour to obtain information without proper authorisation from the account holder for financial gain. Among different ways of committing frauds, skimming is the most common one, which is a way of duplicating information that is located on the magnetic strip of the card. Apart from this, following are the other ways:

- Manipulation/alteration of genuine cards
- Creation of counterfeit cards
- Stealing/loss of credit cards
- Fraudulent telemarketing
